            <strong>The French Press</strong> is a coffee brewing device patented by Italian designer Attilio Calimani in 1929. Also known as a coffee press or cafeti√®re, the French word for coffee maker or pot.

            Why is it better than my own coffee maker?
            </h2>
            <p class="p2"> 
            <strong>When used with freshly ground beans,</strong> their flavors are released throughout the hot water for a few minutes. When the beans are compressed onto the bottom, it leaves the strong, fresh coffee flavors without the bitterness of other coffee makers.

             How Does it Work?
            </h2>
        <div>
            <div class=p2>
            <strong>Coffee is brewed by placing coarsely ground coffee beans into the empty glass beaker and adding hot water.</strong> The brewing time is about four minutes. Then the mesh plunger or piston is pressed down, to separate the grounds and hold them at the bottom of the beaker. 
            </div>
            <div class=p2>
            <strong>The French Press</strong> works best with coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter, about the consistency of course salt. Finer grounds, when immersed in water, will cause the coffee to taste bitter.
            </div>
            <div class=p2>
            It is believed that the optimum amount of time for brewing the coffee is around four minutes, and some consider the coffee spoiled if it sits in the press for longer than twenty minutes.
